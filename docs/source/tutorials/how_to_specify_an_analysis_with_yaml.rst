How to specify an analysis with YAML
====================================

The domain-specific language (DSL) developed for ImmuneML defines what the analysis YAML
specification should look like. Depending on the specification, ImmuneML can execute
different tasks (perform hyperparameter optimization, perform exploratory analyses or
make simulated immune receptor datasets (i.e., implant signals [e.g., k-mers] into
existing immune receptor repertoire datasets). For full documentation, see :ref:`Specification`.
An example of the full specification for performing hyperparameter
optimization by nested cross-validation is given below.

Structure of the analysis specification
---------------------------------------

The analysis specification consists of three main parts: definitions, instructions and output.

Specifying Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Definitions refer to components, which will be used within the instructions. They include:

- Datasets definitions: specifying where data is located and how it should be imported,

- Preprocessing sequences: defining preprocessing steps to be taken on the dataset,

- Encodings: different data representation techniques,

- ML methods: different machine learning methods (e.g. SVM or KNN),

- Reports: specific analysis to be run on different parts of the data, ML methods or results,

- Motifs: parts of the simulation definition defined by a seed and a way to create specific motif instances from the seed,

- Signals: parts of the simulation which can include multiple motifs and correspond to a single label for subsequent classification tasks,

- Simulations: define how to combine different signals and how to implant them in the dataset.

Each component is defined using a key (a string) that uniquely identifies it and which
will be used in the instructions to refer to the component defined in this way.
For example, a dataset used in Emerson et al. 2017 (Nature Genetics), may  be defined
as follows:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  Emerson2017_dataset: # user-defined key (dataset name)
    format: AdaptiveBiotech
    params:
      path: ./Emerson2017/
      result_path: ./Emerson2017_ImmuneML/

Components are defined within the respective section denoting their type.
All component sections are located under `definitions` in the specification file.
An example of sections with defined components is given below:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  definitions:
    datasets:
      Emerson2017_dataset:
        format: AdaptiveBiotech
        params:
          path: ./Emerson2017/
          result_path: ./Emerson2017_ImmuneML/
    encodings:
      kmer_freq_encoding: KmerFrequency
    ml_methods:
      log_reg: LogisticRegression
    preprocessing_sequences:
      beta_chain_filter:
        - ChainRepertoireFilter:
            keep_chain: B
    reports:
      seq_length_distribution: SequenceLengthDistribution
    motifs:
      simple_motif:
      seed: AAA
      instantiation: GappedKmer
    signals:
      simple_signal:
        motifs:
          - simple_motif
        implanting: HealthySequence
    simulation:
      my_simulation:
        my_implanting:
          signals:
            - simple_signal
          dataset_implanting_rate: 0.5
          repertoire_implanting_rate: 0.1

Specifying Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instructions are defined similarly  to components: a key represents an identifier of
the instruction and type denotes the instruction that will be performed. The components,
which were defined previously will be used here as input to instructions.
The parameters for the instructions depend on the type of the instruction.
Instruction specification is located under “instructions” in the specification file.

Possible instructions are:

- Hyperparameter optimization

- Exploratory analysis

- Simulation

An example of the specification for a hyperparameter optimization instruction is as follows:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  instruction1:
    type: HPOptimization
    settings:
    - preprocessing: None
      encoding: kmer_freq_encoding
      ml_method: log_reg
    - preprocessing: beta_chain_filter
      encoding: kmer_freq_encoding
      ml_method: log_reg
    assessment:
      split_strategy: random
      split_count: 1
      training_percentage: 70
      reports:
        data_splits: [seq_length_distribution]
    selection:
      split_strategy: k_fold
      split_count: 5
    labels: [CMV]
    dataset: Emerson2017_dataset
    strategy: GridSearch
    metrics: [accuracy]
    optimization_metric: accuracy
    reports: []

Output - HTML
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The output section of the specification defines the summary output of the execution of
the immuneML. Currently, only HTML output format is supported. If it is specified,
then index.html file will be created with links to a separate HTML file for each
instruction that was listed in the specification. The instruction HTML pages will
include an overview of the instruction parameters (e.g. information on the dataset,
number of examples, type of the dataset, the details of nested cross-validation,
metrics used) and results (overview of performance results in nested cross-validation,
outputs of individual reports). At this point, the HTML output is not customizable.

Running the specified analysis
------------------------------

To run an instruction via command line with the given specification (saved as YAML file):

.. code-block:: console

  python3 ImmuneMLApp.py path/to/specification.yaml result/folder/path/

Alternatively, create an ImmuneMLApp object in a Python script and pass it the path parameter to the constructor before calling its `run()` method as follows:

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

  from source.app.ImmuneMLApp import ImmuneMLApp

  app = ImmuneMLApp(specification_path="path/to/specification.yaml", result_path="result/folder/path/")
  app.run()
